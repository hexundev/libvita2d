## VITA2DLIB

Simple and Fast (using the GPU) 2D library for the PSVita

Install it by executing `./install-all.sh` of [vdpm](https://github.com/vitasdk/vdpm#readme).


## Additions to libvita2d

This fork includes a few additions I needed.

- Multiply blend mode added along with an enum for blend modes
- vita2d_vertex_bufferfor rendering data that does not need to be changed often
- Set a custom matrix for rendering with vita2d_set_matrix
- A couple of misc functions for convenience


## Samples
To be added.
